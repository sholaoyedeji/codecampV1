    <h2>General Information about agriculture in Finland</h2>
<p align="justify" >
Finland is the northernmost country in the world which is capable of producing most of the food it needs. 
The conditions are severe, but the breeds, varieties and methods developed over centuries allow viable farming this far in the north.
The structure of Finnish agriculture has changed in recent years. The number of farms has decreased by two to three per cent a year, in livestock production by as much as seven per cent. In 2010 the number of active farms was 62,800. Efforts have been made to improve efficiency and increase the farm size to respond to the challenges of the time.
The majority of Finnish farms produce milk or cultivate cereals. Most of the farms derive additional income from forests. Of the cereal species, the cultivation of barley, oats, wheat and rye succeeds in our northern conditions. Several special crops are also cultivated. About a quarter of the cultivated area is under grass. Peas, carrots, onions, cabbages and certain other vegetables are grown outdoors, while tomatoes, cucumbers and potted lettuce and herbs are grown in greenhouses round the year.
The average arable area of Finnish farms is 36,7 hectares and forest area is 48 hectares. Every fifth farm produces milk; most of these are located in eastern and northern Finland. The average number of cows is 30 and the average yield per cow is nearly 8,000 litres a year.
More than half of the farms produce cereals, and most of these farms are in southern Finland. The majority of them grow barley, oats and wheat. The average arable area of cereal farms is 34.7 hectares. Finnish agriculture is still based on family farms. Almost all Finnish farms are owned by individual farmers or farming families. The average age of farmers is 50 years.
